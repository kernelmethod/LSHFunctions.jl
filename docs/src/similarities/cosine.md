## Definition
[Cosine similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity), roughly speaking, measures the angle between a pair of inputs. Two inputs are very similar if the angle between them is low, and their similarity drops as the angle between them increases.

Concretely, cosine similarity is computed as

```math
\text{cossim}(x,y) = \frac{\left\langle x,y\right\rangle}{\|x\|\cdot\|y\|} = \left\langle\frac{x}{\|x\|},\frac{y}{\|y\|}\right\rangle
```

where ``\left\langle\cdot,\cdot\right\rangle`` is an inner product (e.g., dot product) and ``\|\cdot\|`` is the norm derived from that inner product. ``\text{cossim}(x,y)`` goes from ``-1`` to ``1``, where ``-1`` corresponds to low similarity and ``1`` corresponds to high similarity. To calculate cosine similarity, you can use the [`cossim`](@ref) function exported from the `LSH` module:

```jldoctest
julia> using LSHFunctions, LinearAlgebra

julia> x = [5, 3, -1, 1];  # norm(x) == 6

julia> y = [2, -2, -2, 2]; # norm(y) == 4

julia> cossim(x,y) == dot(x,y) / (norm(x)*norm(y))
true

julia> cossim(x,y) == (5*2 + 3*(-2) + (-1)*(-2) + 1*2) / (6*4)
true
```

## SimHash
*SimHash*[^1][^Charikar02] is a family of LSH functions for hashing with respect to cosine similarity. You can generate a new hash function from this family by calling [`SimHash`](@ref):

```jldoctest; setup = :(using LSHFunctions)
julia> hashfn = SimHash();

julia> n_hashes(hashfn)
1

julia> hashfn = SimHash(40);

julia> n_hashes(hashfn)
40
```

Once constructed, you can start hashing vectors by calling `hashfn(x)`:

```jldoctest; setup = :(using LSHFunctions, Random; Random.seed!(0)), output = false
hashfn = SimHash(100)

# x and y have high cosine similarity since they point in the same direction
# x and z have low cosine similarity since they point in opposite directions
x = randn(128)
y = 2x
z = -x

hx, hy, hz = hashfn(x), hashfn(y), hashfn(z)

# Among the 100 hash functions that we generated, we expect more hash
# collisions between x and y than between x and z
sum(hx .== hy) > sum(hx .== hz)

# output
true

```

Note that [`SimHash`](@ref) is a one-bit hash function. As a result, `hashfn(x)` returns a `BitArray`:

```jldoctest; setup = :(using LSHFunctions)
julia> hashfn = SimHash();

julia> n_hashes(hashfn)
1

julia> hashes = hashfn(randn(4));

julia> typeof(hashes)
BitVector (alias for BitArray{1})

julia> length(hashes)
1
```

Since a single-bit hash doesn't do much to reduce the cost of similarity search, you usually want to generate multiple hash functions at once. For instance, in the snippet below we sample 10 hash functions, so that `hashfn(x)` is a length-10 `BitArray`:

```jldoctest; setup = :(using LSHFunctions)
julia> hashfn = SimHash(10);

julia> n_hashes(hashfn)
10

julia> hashes = hashfn(randn(4));

julia> length(hashes)
10
```

The probability of a hash collision (for a single hash) is

```math
Pr[h(x) = h(y)] = 1 - \frac{\theta}{\pi}
```

where ``\theta = \text{arccos}(\text{cossim}(x,y))`` is the angle between ``x`` and ``y``. This collision probability is shown in the plot below.

```@eval
using PyPlot, LSHFunctions
fig = figure()
hashfn = SimHash()
x = range(-1, 1; length=1024)
y = [LSHFunctions.single_hash_collision_probability(hashfn, xii) for xii in x]

plot(x, y)
title("Probability of hash collision for SimHash")
xlabel(raw"$cossim(x,y)$")
ylabel(raw"$Pr[h(x) = h(y)]$")

savefig("simhash_collision_probability.svg")
```
