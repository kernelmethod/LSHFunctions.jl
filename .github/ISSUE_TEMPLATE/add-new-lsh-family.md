**What similarity measure is this hash function for?**
What similarity function does this LSH family apply to?

**Describe the hash function**
Provide more information about the hash function you would like to see added. Examples of potentially useful information are
- how it's computed, if you can describe or summarize it succinctly
- its time complexity
- its hash collision probability
- If it's a hash function for a similarity that already has an LSH family in the module, describe its advantages and disadvantages compared to the existing LSH family.

**References**
Please provide references that describe the hash function family. You can also add links to other concepts (e.g. the similarity function that the LSH family applies to) if you think it'd help us determine whether or not to add the LSH family to the package.
